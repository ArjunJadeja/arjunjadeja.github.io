## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

* Each input will have **exactly one solution**.
* You may not use the same element twice.
* The answer can be returned in any order.

**Solve Here:** [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

## Examples

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9` | `[0, 1]` |
| `nums = [3,2,4]`, `target = 6` | `[1, 2]` |
| `nums = [3,3]`, `target = 6` | `[0, 1]` |

## Edge Cases

1. **Multiple identical numbers**: The array may have duplicate numbers, but only one solution exists.
2. **Small arrays**: For example, `nums = [1, 2]`, `target = 3`, where only two elements exist.

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Brute Force Approach

* **Description**: Iterate through each pair of numbers and check if they sum up to the target.
* **Time Complexity**: O(n²) – Nested loops checking every pair.
* **Space Complexity**: O(1) – No additional data structures used.

```kotlin
fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
    for (i in nums.indices) {
        for (j in i + 1 until nums.size) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                return intArrayOf(i, j)
            }
        }
    }
    return intArrayOf()
}
```

### 2. Using HashMap

* **Description**: Use a `HashMap` to store the difference between the target and each number as you iterate through the array. If the difference is found in the map, you have your solution.
* **Time Complexity**: O(n) – Single pass through the array.
* **Space Complexity**: O(n) – Extra space for the `HashMap`.

```kotlin
fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
    val prevMap = HashMap<Int, Int>()
    for (i in nums.indices) {
        val num = nums[i]
        val diff = target - num
        if (prevMap.containsKey(diff)) {
            return intArrayOf(prevMap[diff]!!, i)
        }
        prevMap[num] = i
    }
    return intArrayOf()
}
```

## Complexity Comparison

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Brute Force | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Using HashMap | O(n) | O(n) |

## Conclusion

While the **brute force** method is simple and easy to understand, it has poor performance for large arrays due to its O(n²) time complexity. The **HashMap** approach is much more efficient with O(n) time complexity, making it the preferred solution for most cases.
