## Why?
-> To reduce overthinking and avoiding anxiety & panic.
-> Train the mind like training body.

## Problems
-> Brain stuck in “what if” loops (future problems, alternate-case scenarios).
-> Body locked in stress mode (nervous system doesn’t get the “all clear” signal).

## Scheduled Overthinking/Worry time
-> Every day at 5:30 PM give 15 minutes to allow overthinking and write down thoughts. Outside that time, if thoughts pop up, remind: “Not now. I’ll think at 05:30 PM.”

## 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding trick
-> Notice 5 things you see, 4 touch, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste. Brings you back from spiraling thoughts.

## 🌅 Morning Calm Routine (5–7 min)

1. **Sunlight & Breath (2 min)**  
   Step outside or near a window.  
   Take **5 deep breaths** (inhale through nose, slow exhale through mouth).

2. **Gratitude / Intention (1–2 min)**  
   Write down **1 thing you’re grateful for** and **1 thing you want today**  
   *(e.g., “Grateful for my health. Today I want to stay calm in challenges.”)*

3. **Mini Grounding (2–3 min)**  
   Notice: **3 things you see, 2 things you hear, 1 thing you feel.**  
   Brings the mind into the present.

## 🌙 Night Calm Routine (7–10 min)

1. **Phone off / dim lights (15–30 min before bed)**  
   Signal your brain that the day is ending.

2. **Journaling dump (2–3 min)**  
   Write down: *“What’s on my mind?”* — empty thoughts onto paper.

3. **Body Scan or Breathing (3–5 min)**
  - Option A: **4–7–8 breathing** (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8, repeat 4 times).
  - Option B: Mentally scan body parts from head to toes, relaxing each.

4. **Positive closure (1 min)**  
   End with: *“Today is done. I did my best. Tomorrow is a new day.”*

## 🔑 Key Tips
- **Consistency > length** → even 3–5 minutes daily trains your brain.
- **Don’t aim for an empty mind** → just aim for gentler, slower thoughts.
- If panic or overthinking comes in the day, do **3 deep breaths** or the **5-4-3-2-1 grounding trick**.
